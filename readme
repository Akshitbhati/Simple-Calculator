the calculator is made very simple. the new concepts learned are 
1) Array.from() :- Creates an array from string. It returns an array from any object with a length property and any iterable object
2) eval() :- The eval() method evaluates or execute an arument, If the argument is expression then it evaluates the epression or if the argument is
javascript statement if evaluates the statement, 

WE SHOULD NEVER USE EVAL() because
1) Evaluates JAVASCRIPT from string is an BIG security risk
2) Malicious code can run inside the application without permission
3) Third party can see the scope of your application which can lead to possible attacks
